# AI-Enhanced Infrastructure Reporting

**AI-Enhanced Infrastructure Reporting** is a groundbreaking platform that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to transform how citizens report and address urban infrastructure issues. By integrating advanced AI technologies, the platform automates the process of detecting, classifying, and prioritizing urban infrastructure problems based on severity and urgency.
Only the model is added. Further work will be added later.
## Key Features

1. **Image-Based Issue Reporting**  
   Citizens can easily upload images of infrastructure issues such as potholes, broken streetlights, or damaged roads.

2. **AI-Powered Image Analysis**  
   The AI algorithms instantly analyze the uploaded images, detecting and classifying the issues, ensuring quick and accurate reports.

3. **Prioritization of Issues**  
   The platform automatically assesses the severity of each issue and generates a priority score based on its potential impact on public safety.

4. **Geo-Tagging**  
   The system automatically tags the exact location of the issue using GPS data or image metadata, ensuring precise location identification.

## How It Works

- **Step 1**: The citizen uploads an image of an infrastructure issue.
- **Step 2**: AI algorithms detect the issue, categorize it (e.g., pothole, broken streetlight), and assess its severity.
- **Step 3**: The platform geotags the issue using GPS metadata or AI-based geolocation analysis.
- **Step 4**: The issue is categorized, prioritized, and reported to local authorities for resolution.

## Benefits

- **Faster Reporting**: Citizens can report infrastructure issues quickly and accurately.
- **Smarter Urban Management**: Local authorities can prioritize issues based on urgency and impact.
- **Community Engagement**: Citizens actively participate in city maintenance, contributing to the overall well-being of the community.

By integrating AI into the infrastructure management process, this platform helps make cities safer, smarter, and more sustainable.
